# Backgrounds
- We initiated this project to deepen our understanding of the ongoing advancements and emerging trends in the field of recommendation systems.  
- We chose **LightGCN** and **GLocal-K** to develop models that precisely capture users’ inherent preferences while ensuring scalability and efficiency.  
- As research increasingly explores integrating recommendation systems with large language models (LLMs), we plan to maintain an active interest and continue our exploration in this direction.
